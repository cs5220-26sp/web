# CS 5220 sp-2026

This is the course material repository for Cornell [CS 5220][cs5220]
for the Spring 2026 semester.  This repository will contain lectures, homework assignments, reference codes, utilities, and the
source for the class web site.  Feel free to use the code, TeX files,
or other materials here; also, feel free to post pull requests if you
see items that ought to be corrected.

I encourage you to use Git for your own work, but please do
*not* put your assignment solutions in public [GitHub][gh] repositories.
[GitHub][gh] and [BitBucket][bb] both offer private repositories.
