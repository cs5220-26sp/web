    To the best of my understanding, only CS MEng students can enroll directly. If you are not a CS MEng student (e.g., PhD, undergraduate, or non-CS MEng), you need to add yourself to the waitlist. If you cannot, please open a <a href="https://tdx.cornell.edu/TDClient/193/Portal/Home/">ticket</a>.

    If you are an undergraduate or non-CS major, you may enroll in the class as long as you meet the prerequisites. Once your relevant <a href="https://registrar.cornell.edu/calendars-exams/academic-calendar">add period begins</a>, you can add yourself to the <b>waitlist</b>. Priority is given to CS majors in the following order: graduate, senior, junior, sophomore, and freshman, followed by other majors in the same order. The cap is 160, so I expect everyone who wants to enroll to be able to do so.
