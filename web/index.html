    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      CS 5220 is an introduction to performance tuning and parallelization,
      particularly for scientific codes. Topics include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Single-processor architecture, caches, and serial performance tuning</li>
      <li>Basics of parallel machine organization</li>
      <li>Parallel distributed memory programming with MPI</li>
      <li>Parallel shared memory programming with OpenMP</li>
      <li>GPU programming with CUDA</li>
      <li>Cerebras programming with CSL</li>
      <li>Parallel patterns: data partitioning, synchronization, and load balancing</li>
      <li>Parallel numerical algorithms</li>
      <li>Parallel graph algorithms</li>
      <li>Parallel algorithms in science and engineering</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To succeed in CS 5220, students should be able to read and write serial programs in C++ or a related language (e.g., C) and be familiar with computer architecture (e.g., CS 3410 at Cornell). Because examples will be drawn primarily from engineering and scientific computations, some prior exposure to numerical methods is useful but not required.

      Prior exposure to parallel programming is not required, and non-CS students from fields involving simulation and data-intensive applications are particularly welcome!
