This is a list of useful resources that will be updated throughout the semester. Hopefully they are useful!

## Perlmutter/NERSC

### [NERSC User Group Slack](https://www.nersc.gov/users/user-news/join-the-nersc-users-slack-sponsored-by-nug-today)

This is a Slack channel where you can get quick answers to a lot of questions that may come up throughout the semester regarding Perlmutter and using Perlmutter. Most of the people on this channel are experts and will be able to give you good advice. You can also look through past threads on this Slack to see if someone else had your issue.

### [Perlmutter Queue Time Estimator](https://www.nersc.gov/users/status/queue-wait-times)

When you submit a batch job to Perlmutter, it will be placed in a queue with other user-submitted jobs, and you will have to wait your turn. Dealing with queueing delays can be frustrating, especially when you don't have a good sense of how long you might have to wait. Thankfully, NERSC provides a tool that will give you a ballpark estimate of how long you will probably have to wait for your job to run. This can help with planning and sanity maintenance.

### [Perlmutter Jobscript Generator](https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/jobscript-generator/)

An important part of using Perlmutter is developing an understanding of how to write Slurm job scripts. Most of the homeworks in this class will come with job scripts that we have written for you, but at some point (particularly during the final project) you might need to write your own. This is a great resource for automatically generating job scripts based on a set of higher-level and more intuitive specifications.

### [NERSC Help Desk](https://help.nersc.gov/)

This is the NERSC Help Desk, where you can submit detailed help tickets explaining a significant issue you are having and get feedback from experts. You can also look through past and resolved help tickets to see if anyone else had your problem. This is more heavy-duty than the NERSC Slack and intended for serious issues. You are most likely not going to need this during the course, but it is here just in case.
