This is a list of useful resources that will be updated throughout the semester. Hopefully they are useful!

## Perlmutter/NERSC

### [NERSC User Group Slack](https://www.nersc.gov/users/user-news/join-the-nersc-users-slack-sponsored-by-nug-today)

This Slack channel provides quick answers to many questions that may arise during the semester about Perlmutter and its use. You can also review past threads to see if someone else has encountered your issue. You should **not** open use the NERSC Slack for any questions related to CS 5220 assignments or related debugging. Course-related questions should be posted on [EdDiscussion][ed]. **If in doubt, post on [Ed][ed] first.**

### [Perlmutter Queue Time Estimator](https://www.nersc.gov/users/status/queue-wait-times)

If you submit a batch job to Perlmutter, it is placed in a queue with other user-submitted jobs, and you must wait your turn. Queueing delays can be frustrating, especially when you do not know how long you might have to wait. Thankfully, NERSC provides a tool that gives you a rough estimate of how long you will probably wait for your job to run. This can help with planning and maintaining peace of mind.

### [Perlmutter Jobscript Generator](https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/jobscript-generator/)

An important part of using Perlmutter is learning to write Slurm job scripts. The homework assignments in this class will include provided job scripts, but at some point, especially during the final project, you may need to write your own. This resource is useful for automatically generating job scripts from higher-level, more intuitive specifications.

### [NERSC Help Desk](https://help.nersc.gov/)

This is the NERSC Help Desk, where you can submit detailed help tickets describing significant issues and receive feedback from experts. You can also review past and resolved help tickets to see if others have encountered your problem. This resource is more robust than the NERSC Slack and is intended for serious issues. You are unlikely to need this during the course, but it is available if necessary. You should **not** open NERSC tickets for any questions related to CS 5220 assignments or related debugging. Course-related questions should be posted on [EdDiscussion][ed]. **If in doubt, post on [Ed][ed] first.**
